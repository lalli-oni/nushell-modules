                <p>We intend to create helpful learning resources to help people get started writing their own tools using nushell.</p>

                <p>We intend to create nushell scripts to streamline Developer Experience. These scripts are heavily opinionated in process and integrations to begin with so we can achieve a streamlined user flow. Subsequently we can add more integration and more flows.</p>

                <h2>Me</h2>
                <p>Larus Thor (@lalli-oni). Originally from Iceland, living in Denmark. Varied background but shifted my focus towards frontend engineering. I like to throw myself at problems with the least amount of attention. And frontend zeitgeist has struck me as being reductionist and (please excuse the drama) marginalised.</p>
                <p>Hopefully with traction this becomes less about me and more about the project value.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Project Background</h2>
                <p>After fucking up rebasing my feature branches on release branch ðŸ˜… embarassingly many times I decided to write a shell script to both automate the process and to understand better what I was doing wrong/right.</p>
                <p>Originally I created this script in zsh. Finding the language and environment extremely undfriendly. Making it hard to write good code. Being unsatisfied I looked a bit into other terminal approaches, like ruby or googles zx (js). But adding a language layer on top of the shell breaks my top programming annoyance: mixing programming languages (currently working with tsx, the oriny is not lost on me).</p>
                <p>Took surprisingly long to encounter nushell, which seems to tick a lot of my boxes in terms of philosophy. I hope to help address (imo) the biggest flaw of nushell: lack of resources. The documentation is subjectively decent, but I find it lacking in some key aspects which I hope to contribute to either here or directly.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Web app(?)</h2>
                <p>As I mentioned above, I focus on frontend, and unsurprisingly most of my work is in web apps (notably: ts, vue, react, svelte, jQuery, webpack). Utilising this web page also as a personal learning resource (in hopes of sharing) I decided to see how far native HTML/css can take you in developing a modern web app. But is it a web app? You are viewing a HTML <strong>document</strong>after all. What makes this an app(lication)?</p>
                <p>Please don't take this experiment as a message of native superiority over the various web app frameworks but as a learning experiment.</p>
