# nushell-modules Web App
Goal is to provide supplementary learnings for nushell and provide documentation for the modules.

## Dependencies
Well, nothing actually! Intended to be a native SPA using pure HTML/CSS with as little javascript as possible.
Mostly intended to be an experiment on viability of using native technologies to develop a relatively small static page.

⚠️ Need to look into browser support and whether we need to provide polyfills.
